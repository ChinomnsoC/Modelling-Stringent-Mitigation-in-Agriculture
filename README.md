# Modelling-Stringent-Mitigation-in-Agriculture

## Summary: 
This was an assignment done in partial fulfilment of the MSc Environment and Development program at the University of Leeds. This assignment has been submitted and graded. Using the Finite amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) simple climate model, agricultural greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to a net-zero over 30 years (2021-2050)to model stringent mitigation in agriculture, and the impact of this future climate scenario on global temperature was determined. Stringent mitigation in agriculture in the emission scenario modelled implies zero N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from agriculture (estimated) and sequestration of CO2 that affects both CO2 from land-use, as well as 20% of CO2 from fossil fuel emissions. In 2017, approximately 75% and 42% of total N2O and CH4 emissions respectively were estimated to be from agriculture (Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), 2020). This makes the case for how zero N2O and CH4 emissions from agriculture are determined in the emission scenario. The results show that rigid mitigation in agriculture alone cannot limit warming to below 1.5˚c or well below 2˚c till the year 2100, even though it means zero emissions from agriculture – hence other sectors must play their parts. 


## Results:
The FaIR model was used to simulate the contribution of mitigation in agriculture to the achievement of the 1.5˚c target where no other sector contributed to mitigation. This accounts for two things: it assumes zero emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> from agriculture and it accounts for sequestering of CO2 (all of CO2 Land Use emissions and 20% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel). In the scenario, emission changes are fixed within the year 2021 to 2050 but portray the effect that this mitigation (as described) will have on the global surface mean temperature from 2021 till 2500. Each of these assumptions is determined both separately and together and illustrated likewise (Fig 1-4). To determine the emissions (measured in GtCO2/yr) in this analysis, one of 4 Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios - RCP 4.5 – was used and this RCP 4.5 represents a 4.5 Wm−2 forcing by the year 2100.

## Methods:
CH4 and N2O: The agriculture sector is the largest contributor to non-CO<sub>2</sub>  greenhouse gas emissions (based on the amount of emissions that it contributes) (Frank et al., 2019). Non-CO<sub>2</sub> greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture include N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub>. In the experiment, N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> values from 2021 to 2050 were reduced by 75% and 42% respectively (to portray zero N<sub>2</sub>O and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from agriculture), and the temperature predictions from that climate scenario were placed at par with the values from the RCP 4.5 projections. In practical, this scenario may imply zero livestock farming and a total overhaul of crop-soil management practices.

Carbon Sequestration: In this part of the experiment, carbon sequestration from 2021 and 2050 was modelled and compared with the projections from RCP 4.5. To model carbon sequestration in agriculture, the negative values for CO2 land use within the said time frame were used. Also, 20% of CO2 from fossil fuels was removed for the same time frame. This was to account for the fact that in sequestering atmospheric CO2, some of the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel will be sequestered as well.
